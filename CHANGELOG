and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-18
### Added
- Shape Transform Support.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-06-10
### Changed
- **Verilog Interface:** Changed default endianness from big-endian to little-endian.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-03-24
### Added
- **Verilog Interface:** Added handling for Byte Order conversion between Numpy/Torch and Verilog.

## [Unreleased] - 2025-02-25
### Fixed
- **X/Z Value Support:** Fixed issue where IO values treated as `int` caused issues with `BinaryValue` containing X/Z states.
    - Previously, signals with X/Z were implicitly treated as 0 when accessed via `integer`.
    - `Vector.from_cocotb()` (formerly `Hensor.from_cocotb()`) now explicitly handles `integer` conversion and issues a warning (non-blocking) if X/Z values are detected.
    - Note: Verilator backend defaults X to 0/1. Z values are internal. X propagation is more visible with VCS backend.
